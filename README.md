### Hi there 👋

🤔我的翻译不一定100%准确，但可以保证中国人可以看懂，看的较为流畅。   
😄欢迎基于我的翻译进行改进  
🤔My translation is not necessarily 100% accurate, but it can be guaranteed that Chinese people can understand and read it fluently.  
😄I've been here all the time, If you want to update the Chinese Translation please feel free to @me  
🫡I don't always check every mods' language file, so you have to @me to keep the translations up to date
